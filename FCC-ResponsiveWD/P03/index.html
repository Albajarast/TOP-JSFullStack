      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that
        there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with
        different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.

      <p>And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from
        up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still
        some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I
        suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.</p>

        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
        horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
        belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
        seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him,
        waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.
